# hello-world01012017
This is the hello world app done again. I am trying to lean GIT.....again
THis is Antonio Barbra and I am trying to learn how to use version control resources. I hope that 2017 is my year as a developer. I wish that i would have started this journey in my early twenties instead of my late thirties but that was the path chosen.
